        <p>Hello! My name is Hunter Mustain and I am starting an incredible journey in web development. I'm an 80's baby and grew up with the internet and I've seen it evolve over the years to what it has become today. I have always been someone that enjoys a challenge and the word "can't" just isn't in my vocabulary, I am someone who will find a way and figure it out. So, when the opportunity came to me to advance my knowledge in web development I jumped at the chance! I can't wait to see where this journey takes me, come take a ride with me.</p>

        <p>I am currently the Vice President of Operations for an ecommerce company in the San Antonio area. I specialize in Logistics & Web Services. I have 10+ years of experience in the logistics world, but very little with website management. That little experience, and the desire to want to learn more, is what led me into continuing education in Full Stack Development. I have been married to my wonderful wife, Amy, for 10 years and together we have 5 year old twins Barrett & Romy!</p>

        <p>I am still very green in this journey, but here are a few technologies I have been working with</p>
